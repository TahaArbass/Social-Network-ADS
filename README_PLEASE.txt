In order to visualize the graphs generated by the Social Network Project, we utilize Graphviz, a third-party tool for graph visualization. Follow the steps below to configure Graphviz for use within the project:

a- Install GraphViz: download using this link https://graphviz.org/download/
b- Go to the windows section and select the latest version (11.0.0) and download the 64 bit zip archive.
c- Extract the folder out of the zip file.

d- Set Environment Variables:
Ensure that the Graphviz binaries are accessible to the project by setting the path to the Graphviz "bin" directory in your system's environment variables.
On Windows:
     1- Open the Start menu and search for "Environment Variables."
     2- Click on "Edit the system environment variables."
     3- In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables..." button.
     4- In the Environment Variables window, under "System variables," find the "Path" variable and select it, then click "Edit..."

     5- Click "New" and paste the path to the "bin" directory inside the Graphviz installation folder. For example, if Graphviz is installed in "C:\Program Files\Graphviz", the path will be "C:\Program Files\Graphviz\bin".

     6- Click "OK" to save the changes.

e- Verify Configuration:
        ~ Ensure that the Graphviz binaries are correctly configured by verifying that the project can access them.
        ~ You should be able to use Graphviz's command-line tools or libraries within the project to generate visualizations from the graph files provided.

By following these steps, you'll configure Graphviz for visualization within the Social Network Project.
